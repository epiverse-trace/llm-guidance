finalsize,finalsize is an R package to calculate the final size of a SIR epidemic in populations with heterogeneity in social contacts and infection susceptibility.,trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/finalsize
serofoi,"serofoi is an R package to estimate the Force-of-Infection (FoI) of a given pathogen from age-disaggregated population-based cross-sectional serosurveys, using a Bayesian framework. The package provides a set of features for assessing model fitting, convergence and visualisation.",trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi
epiparameter,epiparameter is an R package that contains a library of epidemiological parameters for infectious diseases and a set classes and helper functions to be able to work with the data. It also includes functions to extract and convert parameters from reported summary statistics.,trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter
superspreading,superspreading is an R package that provides a set of functions to estimate and understand individual-level variation in transmission from secondary cases.,trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading
linelist,"linelist provides a safe entry point to the Epiverse software ecosystem, adding a foundational layer through tagging, validation, and safeguarding epidemiological data, to help make data pipelines more straightforward and robust.",trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist
sivirep,"Current version of sivirep provides functions for data wrangling and automated reports based on linelist data from SIVIGILA, which is the official epidemiological surveillance system for Colombia, South America.",trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/sivirep
cleanepi,cleanepi provides functions to clean epidemiological data provided in the form of a data frame or other related data type.,trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cleanepi
datadelay,"datadelay is an R package to estimate disease severity and under-reporting in real-time, accounting for delays in epidemic time-series. datadelay provides simple, fast methods to calculate the overall or static case fatality ratio (CFR) of an outbreak up to a given time point, as well as how the CFR changes over the course of the outbreak. datadelay can help estimate disease under-reporting in real-time, accounting for delays reporting the outcomes of cases.",trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/datadelay
epiCo,"epiCo provides functions for clustering, regression, now casting, and sup reporting analyses vector-borne diseases in Colombia.",trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiCo
epidemics,"epidemics is an R package that provides a convenient interface to a library of compartmental models that can help to model epidemic scenarios for directly transmitted infections such as influenza, Covid-19, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The models in epidemics implement methods outlined in Bj¿rnstad et al. (2020a) and Bj¿rnstad et al. (2020b). The models in epidemics can help provide rough estimates of the course of epidemics, and the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions.",trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epidemics
epichains,"epichains is an R package to simulate, analyse, and visualize the size and length of branching processes with a given offspring distribution. These models are often used in infectious disease epidemiology, where the chains represent chains of transmission, and the offspring distribution represents the distribution of secondary infections caused by an infected individual.",trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains
readepi,readepi provides functions for importing data into R from files and common health information systems.,trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/readepi
episoap,This package provides a store of curated outbreak analytics pipelines as rmarkdown reports.,trace,https://github.com/epiverse-trace/episoap
epidemia,The epidemia package allows researchers to flexibly specify and fit Bayesian epidemiological models in the style of Flaxman et al. (2020). The package leverages RÕs formula interface to parameterize the time-varying reproduction rate as a function of covariates. Multiple populations can be modeled simultaneously with hierarchical models.,external,https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/epidemia
outbreaker2,"outbreaker2 is a Bayesian framework for integrating epidemiological and genetic data to reconstruct transmission trees of densely sampled outbreaks. It re-implements, generalises and replaces the model of outbreaker, and uses a modular approach which enables fine customisation of priors, likelihoods and parameter movements",external,https://github.com/reconhub/outbreaker2
incidence2,"{incidence2} is an R package that implements functions and classes to compute, handle and visualise incidence from linelist data. It refocusses the scope of the original {incidence} package. Unlike the original package, {incidence2} concentrates only on the initial calculation, manipulation and plotting of the resultant incidence objects.",external,https://github.com/reconverse/incidence2
epicontacts,"epicontacts aims to facilitate manipulation, visualisation and analysis of epidemiological contact data. Such datasets inherently have network components, in which nodes are typically cases and reported contacts or exposures are (directed or undirected) edges. This package provides a convenient data structure as well as functionality specific to handle these data.",external,https://github.com/reconhub/epicontacts
EpiEstim,EpiEstim is a tool to estimate the time-varying instantaneous reproduction number during epidemics,external,https://github.com/mrc-ide/EpiEstim
EpiNow2,"This package estimates the time-varying reproduction number, growth rate, and doubling time using a range of open-source tools (Abbott et al.), and current best practices (Gostic et al.).  It estimates the time-varying reproduction number on cases by date of infection (using a similar approach to that implemented in {EpiEstim})",external,https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2
